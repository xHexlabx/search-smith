[cite_start]The 17th National Computer Olympiad examination, held online at Walailak University, presents Problem 2 out of 3. The exam took place on Saturday, December 11, 2564 BE (2021 CE), from 13:00 to 16:00. [cite: 1]

[cite_start]The problem is titled "Nakhon Market (12.21)". [cite: 2]

[cite_start]This year, the results announcement day for the National Computer Olympiad coincides with the year-end 2021 sales promotion event called "12.21 Promotion" at the Chic & Chill Online Market, known as "Nakhon Market"[cite: 2]. [cite_start]This promotion is colloquially known as "Buy Two, Cheaper"[cite: 2]. [cite_start]This means buying two items on the same receipt will not be more expensive than buying two items separately on different receipts[cite: 2].

For example:
[cite_start]Table 1: Prices for purchasing a single item (bought on separate receipts) [cite: 3]

| Item           | Price (Baht) |
| :------------- | :----------- |
| Fresh Kanom Jeen | 35           |
| Blue Crab      | 50           |
| Mamuang Mut    | 32           |
| Kapi           | 25           |

[cite_start]Table 2: Prices for the "Buy Two, Cheaper" promotion (bought on the same receipt) [cite: 4]

| Item No. | Item 1           | Item 2    | Paired Price (Baht) |
| :------- | :--------------- | :-------- | :------------------ |
| 1        | Fresh Kanom Jeen | Kapi      | 55                  |
| 2        | Kapi             | Blue Crab | 20                  |
| 3        | Mamuang Mut      | Blue Crab | 50                  |
| 4        | Mamuang Mut      | Kapi      | 30                  |

[cite_start]From Tables 1 and 2, if you want two items: Kapi and Fresh Kanom Jeen, you can buy them in two ways[cite: 6]:
1.  [cite_start]Buy separately on two receipts: total price $35 + 25 = 60$ Baht. [cite: 6]
2.  [cite_start]Use the "Buy Two, Cheaper" promotion (Item 1 in Table 2): total price 55 Baht, which is cheaper than method (1). [cite: 6]

[cite_start]The order of items in each "Buy Two, Cheaper" promotion can be swapped, meaning the same pair (e.g., Kapi and Fresh Kanom Jeen for item 1)[cite: 7].

[cite_start]Another example: if you want Mamuang Mut and Blue Crab (or Blue Crab and Mamuang Mut)[cite: 7], there are several ways to buy them:
[cite_start]Table 3: Example purchase methods for Mamuang Mut and Blue Crab [cite: 8]

| Method | Purchase Method                                    | Item Details                         | Total Price (Baht) | Total Items (Units) |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| (a)    | Buy separately on two receipts                     | Mamuang Mut and Blue Crab            | $32+50=82$         | 2                   |
| (b)    | "Buy Two, Cheaper" Item 3 (Table 2)                | Mamuang Mut paired with Blue Crab    | 50                 | 2                   |
| (c)    | "Buy Two, Cheaper" Items 2 and 4 (Table 2)         | Kapi paired with Blue Crab AND Mamuang Mut paired with Kapi | $20+30=50$         | 4                   |

[cite_start]From Table 3, buying using method (b) (Item 3) yields the desired Mamuang Mut and Blue Crab for a total of 50 Baht[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Similarly, buying using method (c) (Items 2 and 4) also costs 50 Baht[cite: 9]. [cite_start]However, method (c) results in 4 items in total, which is more than method (b)'s 2 items[cite: 9].

[cite_start]A pair of regular customers, Mr. A and Mr. B, are close friends[cite: 9]. [cite_start]They each want a different item: Mr. A wants item $P_{q,A}$ and Mr. B wants item $P_{q,B}$, where $P_{q,A} \ne P_{q,B}$[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Crucially, Mr. A does not want to buy item $P_{q,B}$, and Mr. B does not want to buy item $P_{q,A}$[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Any other items purchased together will be split equally between them[cite: 9].

[cite_start]With the year-end 2021 promotion approaching, they want to place an order[cite: 9]. [cite_start]In a single receipt, there can only be one $P_{q,A}$ for Mr. A and one $P_{q,B}$ for Mr. B[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Any other items purchased must be in even quantities so they can be split equally[cite: 9]. [cite_start]This means Mr. A and Mr. B must receive the same items, except for their desired items ($P_{q,A}$ and $P_{q,B}$)[cite: 9].

[cite_start]Therefore, a single receipt may have a purchase pattern of $P_{q,A}, P_{q,x1}, P_{q,x2}, ..., P_{q,xy}, P_{q,B}$, where $P_{q,A}$ and $P_{q,B}$ must be purchased as single items, and any other items not $P_{q,A}$ or $P_{q,B}$ must be purchased in even quantities[cite: 9, 10]. [cite_start]`y` can be any positive integer not exceeding $N-2$, where $N$ is the total number of items[cite: 10]. [cite_start]For example, if Mr. A wants Mamuang Mut ($P_{q,A}$) and Mr. B wants Blue Crab ($P_{q,B}$), considering Table 3, they can purchase according to method (c)[cite: 10]. [cite_start]This allows Kapi to be split into two equal parts [cite: 10][cite_start], resulting in a receipt with Mamuang Mut, Kapi (2 units), and Blue Crab (or Blue Crab, Kapi (2 units), Mamuang Mut)[cite: 10].

**Your Task:**
[cite_start]Write an efficient program to purchase two items under the given conditions[cite: 11]. [cite_start]Consider the purchase pattern (or receipt) with the lowest total price first[cite: 11]. [cite_start]If there is more than one purchase pattern (or receipt) with the lowest total price, choose the purchase pattern (or receipt) that yields the largest total number of items[cite: 11]. [cite_start]Display the total price on that receipt and the total number of items received[cite: 11].

**Input:**
[cite_start]The input consists of $N+M+Q+1$ lines[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]Line 1: Three integers separated by spaces[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]The first number, $N$, specifies the total number of items[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]The second number, $M$, specifies the number of promotion items[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]The third number, $Q$, specifies the number of questions[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]Constraints: $3 \le N \le 500$, $1 \le M < 100,000$, and $1 \le Q \le 10,000$[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]The next $N$ lines: Each line specifies an integer $c_i$, representing the price of item number $i$[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]Constraint: $0 < c_i \le 10^8$[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]The next $M$ lines: Each line specifies one "Buy Two, Cheaper" promotion item, consisting of three integers separated by spaces[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]The first number, $P_{j,1}$, specifies the item number for the first item in promotion item $j$[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]The second number, $P_{j,2}$, specifies the item number for the second item in promotion item $j$[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]The third number, $c_j$, specifies the price when buying the pair in promotion item $j$, where $1 \le j \le M$[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]Constraints: $1 \le P_{j,1}, P_{j,2} \le N$, $P_{j,1} \ne P_{j,2}$, and $0 < c_j \le 2 \times 10^8$[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]Guarantee: If item numbers $P_{j,1}$ and $P_{j,2}$ are specified for promotion item $j$, then the item pair $P_{j,1}$ and $P_{j,2}$ will not appear again, nor will they appear in reverse order, in any other promotion item on other lines[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]The next $Q$ lines: Each line specifies one question, consisting of two integers separated by a space[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]The first number, $P_{q,A}$, specifies the item number for question $q$ ($1 \le q \le Q$) that Mr. A wants but Mr. B does not[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]The second number, $P_{q,B}$, specifies the item number for question $q$ ($1 \le q \le Q$) that Mr. B wants but Mr. A does not[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]Constraints: $1 \le P_{q,A}, P_{q,B} \le N$ and $P_{q,A} \ne P_{q,B}$[cite: 12].

**Output:**
[cite_start]The output consists of $Q$ lines, where $Q$ is the number of questions[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]Line $q$ ($1 \le q \le Q$): Each line displays the result for question $q$, consisting of two integers separated by a space[cite: 15].
    * [cite_start]The first number, $v_q$, represents the lowest total price of the purchase pattern (or receipt) that satisfies the conditions specified in question $q$[cite: 15].
    * [cite_start]The second number, $w_q$, represents the largest total number of items in the purchase pattern (or receipt) that has a total price equal to $v_q$ and satisfies the conditions specified in question $q$[cite: 15].

**Programming Recommendations:**

std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
std::cin.tie(NULL);
```
