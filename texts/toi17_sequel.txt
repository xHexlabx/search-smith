The 17th National Computer Olympiad examination, held online at Walailak University, presents Problem 1 out of 3. The exam took place on Saturday, December 11, 2564 BE (2021 CE), from 13:00 to 16:00.

The problem is titled "The Wall: The Sequel".

When the water barrier wall of Nakhon Thammalat (Nielloware City) was built, it helped protect the city from floods to some extent. However, due to the heartbreaking event of students failing the computer Olympiad exam, tears flooded the city, threatening another major flood. The heir to the Nielloware City ruler needs to prevent another "drama" by inspecting and repairing the built walls. To save effort, a machine manufactured by the RGB Con&De-struction Group will be used for maintenance. This machine inspects the quality of bricks at the foundation of the wall. Preliminary surveys found that there are N bricks in total. Each brick is numbered from 1 to N, ordered from left to right. Brick $i$ has a quality of $A_i$ in Walai Scale units ($1 \le i \le N$).

To use the quality inspection machine, three parameters must be set: L, M, and R.
* L: The starting brick number for the inspection.
* M: The number of bricks to skip each time (step size).
* R: The maximum brick number the machine will inspect.

During operation, the machine will start by inspecting brick L. Then, it will skip M bricks to inspect the next brick: $L+M$, then $L+2M$, $L+3M$, and so on. The inspection continues until $L+KM$ is the largest value that is less than or equal to R. The machine will then stop inspecting and report the sum of the quality of all $K+1$ inspected bricks ($A_L + A_{L+M} + \dots + A_{L+KM}$).

For example, there are $N=11$ bricks, each with the quality values shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: 11 bricks arranged from left to right, with their quality values.
Brick number: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
Quality value: 1 5 2 4 7 3 9 2 2 1 5

If the brick quality inspection is performed with $L=3$, $M=2$, and $R=8$, the machine will inspect bricks as shown in Figure 2. It will report a total brick quality of $2+7+9=18$.
Figure 2: Brick quality inspection with $L=3$, $M=2$, and $R=8$.
(Shows bricks at positions 3, 5, 7 being selected, with qualities 2, 7, 9 respectively).

If the brick quality inspection is performed with $L=2$, $M=5$, and $R=8$, the machine will inspect bricks as shown in Figure 3. It will report a total brick quality of $5+9=14$.

**Your Task:**
Write an efficient program to display the sum of brick qualities in the specified format.

**Input:**
* Line 1: Two integers N and Q, separated by a space.
    * N represents the number of bricks.
    * Q represents the number of inspection queries.
    * Constraint: $1 \le N, Q \le 100,000$.
* Line 2: N integers ($A_i$), separated by spaces, representing the quality of each brick from brick 1 to brick N, in order.
    * Constraints: $-5,000 \le A_i \le 5,000$ and $1 \le i \le N$.
* The next Q lines: Each line specifies one brick inspection command, consisting of three integers $L_j, M_j,$ and $R_j$, separated by spaces.
    * Constraints: $0 < L_j, M_j, R_j \le N$, $1 \le j \le Q$, and $L_j \le R_j$.

**Output:**
One line containing Q integers, separated by single spaces, displaying the sum of brick qualities for each inspection command $j$ (for $1 \le j \le Q$), in the order of the commands.
