[cite_start]The 17th National Computer Olympiad examination, held online at Walailak University, presents Problem 3 out of 3. The exam took place on Saturday, December 11, 2564 BE (2021 CE), from 13:00 to 16:00. [cite: 1]

[cite_start]The problem is titled "T-Junction City". [cite: 2]

[cite_start]Three siblings, Daeng (Red), Khiao (Green), and Fah (Blue), have opened a company called RGB Con&De-struction Group. [cite: 2] [cite_start]Their business is to construct roads connecting various nodes in a city. [cite: 2] [cite_start]The specified nodes for road connections can be endpoints, passing points, or junctions to other nodes. [cite: 2] [cite_start]To ensure comprehensive transportation, roads must always connect all specified points. [cite: 2] [cite_start]The income for constructing each road segment depends on its length. [cite: 2]

[cite_start]Whenever the company receives a job, the three siblings meet to divide the road construction tasks into three parts. [cite: 2] [cite_start]Due to equipment and construction limitations, the road segments assigned to each person must remain connected. [cite: 2] [cite_start]To ensure fairness, several possible plans for dividing the construction tasks are considered. [cite: 2] [cite_start]They evaluate each plan by determining the total distance assigned to each person, identifying the person with the minimum total distance, and what that minimum distance is. [cite: 2] [cite_start]A plan is considered most fair if the minimum total distance achieved by any person in that plan is maximized compared to other plans. [cite: 2]

[cite_start]Currently, in preparation for a visit from a guest from the country of "O-mic-ron", the company has received a contract to build roads connecting various nodes in a city called "T-Junction City". [cite: 2] [cite_start]This city requires the construction of N roads to connect N+1 nodes. [cite: 2] [cite_start]Within this limited time and budget, every node can be connected to only 1, 2, or 3 roads. [cite: 2] [cite_start]Travel between any two nodes via roads will always be unique, meaning there is only 1 path. [cite: 2]

[cite_start]Consider the following example of road construction in T-Junction City: $N=8$. [cite: 3] [cite_start]The nodes are represented by circles numbered 0 to 8. [cite: 3] [cite_start]Roads connecting nodes are shown as lines, with numbers next to the lines indicating the length of each road that the company must build. [cite: 3]

[cite_start]Figure 1 illustrates an example of road construction connecting nodes in T-Junction City, where $N=8$. [cite: 3]

[cite_start]Figure 2 shows two example plans for dividing road construction tasks among Daeng, Khiao, and Fah. [cite: 3] [cite_start]These plans satisfy the condition that the road segments assigned to each person must remain connected. [cite: 3] [cite_start]For easier understanding, both plans divide the roads into three groups: (1) red lines, (2) green lines, and (3) blue lines (the blue may appear as dark blue or navy depending on the display). [cite: 3]

[cite_start]From the example, Plan 1 shows that: [cite: 3]
1.  [cite_start]Daeng is assigned roads totaling $9+8+11+13 = 41$ units. [cite: 3]
2.  [cite_start]Khiao is assigned roads totaling $50+1 = 51$ units. [cite: 3]
3.  [cite_start]Fah is assigned roads totaling $12+32 = 44$ units. [cite: 3]

[cite_start]In Plan 1, Daeng is the person with the minimum total distance, which is 41 units. [cite: 3]

[cite_start]For Plan 2: [cite: 3]
1.  [cite_start]Daeng is assigned roads totaling $9+8+11 = 28$ units. [cite: 3]
2.  [cite_start]Khiao is assigned roads totaling $50+1 = 51$ units. [cite: 3]
3.  [cite_start]Fah is assigned roads totaling $13+12+32 = 57$ units. [cite: 3]

[cite_start]In Plan 2, Daeng is still the person with the minimum total distance, which is 28 units. [cite: 3]

[cite_start]Comparing both plans, Plan 1 is considered fairer than Plan 2. [cite: 4] [cite_start]Additionally, when comparing all other possible road division plans, Plan 1 has the highest minimum total distance assigned to a person, making it the fairest plan. [cite: 4]

**Your Task:**
[cite_start]Write an efficient program to receive road construction data for T-Junction City. [cite: 4] [cite_start]Then, calculate the fairest work allocation plan according to the specified conditions in the problem. [cite: 4] [cite_start]Finally, display the total construction distance of the person assigned the minimum amount of work in that fairest plan. [cite: 4]

**Input:**
* [cite_start]Line 1: An integer N, representing the total number of road segments to build. [cite: 4]
    * [cite_start]Constraint: $5 \le N \le 80,000$. [cite: 4]
* [cite_start]The next N lines: Each line (line $i+1$, for $1 \le i \le N$) provides data for road segment $i$. [cite: 4] [cite_start]Each data set consists of three integers: $U_i$, $V_i$, and $L_i$, separated by a single space. [cite: 4]
    * [cite_start]$U_i$ and $V_i$ represent the node numbers at the two ends of the road segment. [cite: 4]
    * [cite_start]$L_i$ represents the length of road segment $i$. [cite: 4]
    * [cite_start]Constraints: $0 \le U_i, V_i \le N$ and $1 \le L_i \le 20,000$. [cite: 4]

**Output:**
[cite_start]One line with a single integer, displaying the total road construction distance of the person assigned the minimum amount of work in the fairest plan. [cite: 4]
